## From 1.0.x to 1.1.x

When upgrading from `v1.0.X` to `v1.1.X`, a minor modification will need to be
made to the Slurm Helm Chart's values file. The field `jwtHs256KeyRef` was
refactored to the map `jwtKey` for the sake of simplicity and to enable
conditional secret creation and annotation.

The field `jwtHs256KeyRef` must be replaced with the field `jwtKey`.
`jwtKey.create` should be set to false, to prevent slurm-operator from
attempting to create a new secret for the deployment. `jwtKey.secretRef` should
be modified to reference the existing secret in your environment.

For example:

```yaml
jwtKey:
  create: false
  secretRef:
    name: slurm-auth-jwths256
    key: jwt_hs256.key
```
